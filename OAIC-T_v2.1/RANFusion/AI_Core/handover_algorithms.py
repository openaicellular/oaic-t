# handover_algorithms.py is located in the AI_Core folder in the root directory of RANfusion.                                   #
# This file contains a variety of Handover Algorithms that can be used to perform user-defined scenarios.                       #
# The RANfusion load balancer can select and call several plug-and-play algorithms to precisely model mobile user behaviors     #
# and decision-making processes related to handover management.                                                                 #

# Key features:                                                                                                                 #
# 1. Multiple handover algorithms for different scenarios and network conditions                                                #
# 2. Plug-and-play architecture allowing easy addition of new algorithms                                                        #
# 3. Integration with the RANfusion load balancer for dynamic algorithm selection                                               #
# 4. Support for performance evaluation and optimization of handover processes                                                  #
#                                                                                                                               #
# The algorithms in this file work in conjunction with mobility_models.py (is located in the AI_Core  folder) to simulate        #  
# realistic UE movement                                                                                                         #
# and handover decisions. Results and performance metrics can be visualized in the InfluxDB dashboard for easy analysis.        #
#                                                                                                                               #
# Note: This file is part of the AI_Core component, which simplifies performance evaluation and optimization of the RANfusion   #
# system through its modular design.                                                                                            #
