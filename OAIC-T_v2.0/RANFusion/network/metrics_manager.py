# calculating, and managing various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to network performance,     #
# user equipment (UE) behavior, and traffic conditions within the cellular network simulation. This class would act   #

# network load management) and the database, specifically designed to handle the metrics aspect of the simulation.    #
