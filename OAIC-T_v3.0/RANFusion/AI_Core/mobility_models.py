# mobility_models.py is located in the AI_Core folder in the root directory of RANfusion.                                       #
# This file contains various Mobility Models that simulate the movement patterns of User Equipment (UE) in the network.         #
# These models work in conjunction with the Handover Algorithms to create realistic scenarios for testing and optimization.     #
#                                                                                                                               #
# Key features:                                                                                                                 #
# 1. Multiple mobility models representing different UE movement patterns                                                       #
# 2. Plug-and-play architecture allowing easy addition of new mobility models                                                   #
# 3. Integration with the RANfusion load balancer and handover algorithms                                                       #
# 4. Support for generating realistic UE trajectories for various network scenarios                                             #
#                                                                                                                               #
# The mobility models in this file complement the handover algorithms by providing realistic UE movement simulations.           #
# This allows for more accurate testing and optimization of handover processes in different network conditions.                 #
#                                                                                                                               #
# Note: While this file is part of the AI_Core component, it works closely with the mobility management functionality           #
# implemented in /O-CU/mobility_management.py, which handles tasks such as tracking area updates, handovers, and                #
# UE context management during mobility.                                                                                        #
#                                                                                                                               #
# The combination of mobility models and handover algorithms enables comprehensive simulation and analysis of network           #
# performance, with results that can be visualized in the InfluxDB dashboard.                                                   #
